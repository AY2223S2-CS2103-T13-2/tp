## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add Grilled Salmon`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Adding a recipe: `add`

Come up with a new innovative recipe and want to store it for future reference,
and want to classify it by ingredients? Simply run the `add` command, and follow the prompts!

Format:
`add n/RECIPE_NAME d/RECIPE_DURATION p/RECIPE_PORTION [t/RECIPE_TAGS] [s/RECIPE_STEPS] [i/RECIPE_INGREDIENTS]`

> :bulb: Tip: A recipe can have any number of steps, tags and ingredients (including 0)!
> :bulb: Tip: It is only compulsory to include the recipe name when you first add the recipe into recipe book!
> Although optional, we do however still suggest adding in the other fields if possible for your own convenience.
> We recommend you add in your own units of measurement for the optional fields! (i.e g/kg for ingredient weights)
> If you have multiple inputs for tags, steps or ingredients, treat each input as a separate field (i.e s/Step1 s/step2)
> Each field does not have to be input in order (/p can come before /d etc.)
> However, for steps, please input the steps in the order that they are intended to be performed

**Example(s) of usage**:
* `add n/Honey Chicken Rice`
* `add n/Chicken Noodles d/20 minutes p/1-2 people i/chicken thigh i/noodle i/soy sauce`
* `add n/Peanut Butter Sandwich t/breakfast s/Prepare bread and spread s/Using a knife, spread 2-3 scoops of peanut
butter s/Serve`

  
### Listing all recipes: `list`

Ever forget how many recipes you have in your storage? Want to view 'em all? Or
simply want to pick a recipe at random? Just run the `list` command.

Format:
`list`

> Lists all recipes that are in the storage, in the chronological order they were
added. 
> Depending on the size of the window, the user may add multiple columns to display
more recipes.
> In order to zoom in on a particular recipe in the list, user can double-click on the corresponding recipe

### Deleting a recipe: `delete`

No longer like a certain recipe? Simply delete it from the database by its index!

Format: 
`delete [INDEX]`

> Deletes the dish at the specified `INDEX`.
> The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â€¦

Example of usage:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd item stored in the recipe book.

### Clearing the recipe book: `clear`

Want to change things up and start a new recipe book afresh? Simply run the `clear` command to wipe the memory
and start afresh!

Format:
`clear`

### Asking for assistance: `help`

Unsure or unable to remember our list of commands and how to format your inputs? Fret not, as simply inputting
`help` will save you from your woes.

### Exiting the program: `exit`
